Scripts for grabbing current playing song, artist, and status from cmus-remote


get_artist.sh -> grabs the current artist and prints it

get_title.sh -> grabs the current song title and prints it

get_status.sh -> grabs the current status of cmus (playing, paused, stopped)

playing_or_paused.sh -> I use this to display a "by" between my artist and my song dynamically, if its playing or paused (i.e. if playing_or_paused exits with 0  instead of 0) I can print something.
